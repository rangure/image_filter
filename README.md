# File Introduction


Images:

    Example 2D image inputs.

Images/Output:
     
    2D images:
        - Contains directories for each 2D input image.
        - Each directory contains output from each implemented filter.
    3D images:
        -Contains directories for each 3D input.
        - Four sub folders under this directory represent four methods of orthographic projections for confuciusornis and fractures CT scan datasets respectively. Each projection contains four images of without filters, with a 3d gaussian filter with kernal size of 3, with a 3d median filter with kernal size of 5, without any filters but operating on a slab.

        - slicing_x_z.png: Slice in the x-z plane with a constant y value.

        - slicing_y_z.png: Slice in the y-z plane with a constant x value.
